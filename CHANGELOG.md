### Enhancements ###

* Issue [346](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/346) Support JMeter 5.2.1 (5.2 cannot be supported due to issues in its pom.xml files)
* Issue [342](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/342) gui goal generates NPE when clicking on Templates #342  
* Issue [230](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/230) You can now generate multiple configuration profiles that can be bound to specific test executions.
* Issue [335](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/335) You can now use the command line property `-Djmeter.version=5.0` to specify a version of JMeter to be used to build/run the plugin.  Changes to the list of expected libraries will still need modifications to the POM.

### Bug Fixes ###

* Issue [329](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/329) **BREAKING CHANGE** Fix error where default configure goal was always called resulting in config overwrite.  You will now need to always explicitly add the configure execution block to your POM
```
<execution>
    <id>configuration</id>
    <goals>
        <goal>configure</goal>
    </goals>
</execution>
``` 

And to run in GUI mode, call:

    mvn jmeter:configure jmeter:gui

### Enhancements ###

* Issue [319](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/319) Support Apache JMeter 5.1.1.
* Set a default of `<generateReports>false</generateReports>`.  Not everybody wants reports and they take time to generate so they should always be disabled by default.  It will also help reduce confusion around the results file format being ignored if you don't explicitly disable report generation.
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Set minimum Maven version to **3.5.2** which includes some fixes to package and assemble for JDK 9.

### Bug Fixes ###

* Issue [325](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/325) Fix error where we were always logging scanned file type as .jtl.
* Issue [323](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/323) Fix error where existing reports dir would cause build to fail.

* Issue [321](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/321) Fix bug where server log name was malformed if server host was not explicitly set
* Issue [320](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/320) RemoteConfiguration toString printed server list under the tag start.
* Issue [321](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/321) Minor logging bug.  Was previously logging that JMeter GUI was being shut down when in fact JMeter server was being shut down.

## Version 2.0.1 Release Notes

* Issue [183](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/183) - `<resultsFileFormat>` is no longer ignored.

## Version 2.0.0 Release Notes

* **JMeter version 3.0.0 support added.** 
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Location of the .jmx files is now set by using the configuration option `<testFilesDirectory>`:

    		<testFilesDirectory>my/jmx/file/directory</testFilesDirectory>
		</configuration>

* Issue [170](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/170) - add a shutdown hook to destroy the JMeter process if the parent thread is terminated.
* Issue [165](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/165) - Enabled the plugin to continue execution if there are no tests or properties, you will now get a message telling you a test run was skipped if not test files are available.
* Merge pull request [167](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/167) (Thanks [Pascal Treilhes](https://github.com/treilhes)) - You can now use your current maven proxy with the `<useMavenProxy>true</useMavenProxy>` tag, only the first active proxy will be used. `<useMavenProxy>` have a lower priority than `<proxyConfiguration>`.
* You can now specify where logs are saved using the `<logsDirectory>` tag.  This will default to `${project.build.directory}/jmeter/logs`

		<logsDirectory>${project.build.directory}/jmeter/logs</logsDirectory>
		
* Issue [162](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/162) - Reserved properties are now stripped out of custom properties files.

* BREAKING CHANGE: `<workDir>` has been renamed to `<jmeterDirectory>`
* BREAKING CHANGE: Issue [131](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/131)/Issue[160](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/160) Dependency resolution is now performed using the Eclipse Aether libraries.  
	To add artifacts to the lib/ext directory you now need to use:

		<jmeterExtensions>
			<artifact>kg.apc:jmeter-plugins:pom:1.3.1</artifact>
		</jmeterExtensions>
		
	To add libraries to the lib/junit folder you now need to use:
		
		<junitLibraries>
			<artifact>com.lazerycode.junit:junit-test:1.0.0</artifact>
		</junitLibraries>

	The format for artifact elements is: \<groupId\>:\<artifactId\>[:\<extension\>[:\<classifier\>]]:\<version\>
	
	You should no longer need to make these artifacts dependencies of the plugin, we will just got and get the artifact and its associated dependencies.  This should make configuration much easier and less verbose.
	
	This will also allow you to choose the version of JMeter that you use with the plugin, bear in mind that different versions of JMeter depend on a different list of artifacts, you will have to change `<jmeterVersion>` and `<jmeterArtifacts>`:
	
		<jmeterVersion>3.0</jmeterVersion>
	
		<jmeterArtifacts>
			<artifact>com.lazerycode.junit:junit-test:1.0.0</artifact>
		</jmeterArtifacts>
		
	The `<jmeterArtifacts>` list is hard coded by default, if you specify your own version of JMeter you will also have to provide your own list of dependencies. 	
	

* Issue [117](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/117) - You now have the option to scan results files for failed requests and successful requests.  Both are disabled by default since they do have a performance hit.

		<scanResultsForFailedRequests>true</scanResultsForFailedRequests>
		<scanResultsForSuccessfulRequests>true</scanResultsForSuccessfulRequests>

* Issue [125](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/125) - Console output is now clearer when talking about failures.
* Merge pull request [111](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/111) (Thanks [Gordon](https://github.com/gordon00)) - Add support for opening a test file in jmeter:gui
* BREAKING CHANGE: Merge pull request [161](https://github.com/jmeter-maven-plugin/jmeter-maven-plugin/issues/161) (Thanks [Irek Pastusiak](https://github.com/automatictester)) - Add support for multiple custom properties files 

		<customPropertiesFiles>
			<file>someFile</file>

If you don't want to call your advanced log config file "logkit.xml", you can specify the filename using:

		<configuration>
		    <logConfigFilename>myFile.xml</logConfigFilename>
		</configuration>
